    I think the new cell phone law is dumb and is not gonna work. I think that because when the law says "no phone" People are still gonna bring there phones,headphones, eltronic to schools.

  A career im interested is basketball I think computer science can could value in this profession. I say because in the nba or college  they already use computer science for scored boards, field goal perctanges and to see players hot zones in real life. An example from the video is when chris bosh said computer science is valuable for everyone. I think computer science and ai is going to improve and probality take over the world in a few years.

  A real job that heavily relies on drones is a Drone Software Engineer, also known as a drone programmer or engineer. Programmers in this role develop the intricate software and algorithms that allow drones to fly autonomously, process sensor data in real-time, and execute specific tasks like obstacle avoidance, mission planning, and data collection. For example, a drone mapping mission requires software to automatically adjust the drone's height to follow terrain, ensuring consistent and complete data capture for accurate 3D models. According to a search on ZipRecruiter, the average annual salary for a Drone Software Engineer in Texas is approximately $137,441 a year. To enter this field, a bachelor's degree in engineering (such as aerospace, electrical, or computer science) is typically required, in addition to strong programming skills in languages like C++, Python, and ROS (Robot Operating System). Commercial operators must also obtain an FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate to l.egally operate drones for business purposes in the U.S..

 Autcraft was created by Stuart Duncan in 2013 to provide a safe haven for autistic children to play the online game Minecraft after his own son was a target of relentless bullying and harassment in unmoderated public servers. The server addresses the problem of hostile online environments where neurodivergent individuals, who may struggle with social cues and sarcasm, are often exploited and targeted by trolls and griefers, leading to psychological distress and isolation. 
Safe spaces are essential online to protect vulnerable users from various harms prevalent in unmoderated platforms, including cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, online predation, and identity theft. Unmoderated spaces can lead to severe psychological harm and even physical danger, as threats of violence and self-harm content are common issues. Autcraft's design choices, such as strict rules against bullying, 24/7 moderation by a dedicated staff (including parents and autistic adults), and a whitelist application process, ensure a kind and supportive community.
