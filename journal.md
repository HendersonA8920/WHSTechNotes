    I think the new cell phone law is dumb and is not gonna work. I think that because when the law says "no phone" People are still gonna bring there phones,headphones, eltronic to schools. What if u have to give out an important text to one of your family members. or text your mom because u have health issues. My point is the cell phone law is not gonna work until they erase the law all the way.
