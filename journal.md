    I think the new cell phone law is dumb and is not gonna work. I think that because when the law says "no phone" People are still gonna bring there phones,headphones, eltronic to schools. What if u have to give out an important text to one of your family members. or text your mom because u have health issues. My point is the cell phone law is not gonna work until they erase the law all the way.

  A career im interested is basketball I think computer science can could value in this profession. I say because in the nba or college  they already use computer science for scored boards, field goal perctanges and to see players hot zones in real life. An example from the video is when chris bosh said computer science is valuable for everyone. I think computer science and ai is going to improve and probality take over the world in a few years.

    I think it can go both ways u why. I think if u wanna just work in roblox vitual store just for the money it will work but your communication skills will be awful. But if u really want to learn skills though a computer screen i think it will work perfectly. I know this because on the official IKEA website it says " This can help player get a virtual experience and help with skill just like real life". This evidence proves my point that ikea virtual store can help with skils just like in real life.
