    I think the new cell phone law is dumb and is not gonna work. I think that because when the law says "no phone" People are still gonna bring there phones,headphones, eltronic to schools.

My point is the cell phone law is not gonna work until they erase the law all the way.

  A career im interested is basketball I think computer science can could value in this profession. I say because in the nba or college  they already use computer science for scored boards, field goal perctanges and to see players hot zones in real life. An example from the video is when chris bosh said computer science is valuable for everyone. I think computer science and ai is going to improve and probality take over the world in a few years.

    I think it can go both ways u why. I think if u wanna just work in roblox vitual store just for the money it will work but your communication skills will be awful. But if u really want to learn skills though a computer screen i think it will work perfectly. I know this because on the off

  A real job that heavily relies on drones is a Drone Software Engineer, also known as a drone programmer or engineer. Programmers in this role develop the intricate software and algorithms that allow drones to fly autonomously, process sensor data in real-time, and execute specific tasks like obstacle avoidance, mission planning, and data collection. For example, a drone mapping mission requires software to automatically adjust the drone's height to follow terrain, ensuring consistent and complete data capture for accurate 3D models. According to a search on ZipRecruiter, the average annual salary for a Drone Software Engineer in Texas is approximately $137,441 a year. To enter this field, a bachelor's degree in engineering (such as aerospace, electrical, or computer science) is typically required, in addition to strong programming skills in languages like C++, Python, and ROS (Robot Operating System). Commercial operators must also obtain an FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate to l.egally operate drones for business purposes in the U.S..
